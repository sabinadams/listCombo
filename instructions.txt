1) If you don't already have it, install NodeJS from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2) Name the file you want combined list.txt and place it in this folder, or just copy and paste your list
   in to the existing list.txt file.

3) Open your terminal, cd in to this folder, and run "node combo". A new file will be generated called result.txt
   containing your combined list.
